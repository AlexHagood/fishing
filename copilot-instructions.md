📝 Important Note for Future Reference:
DO NOT create UI nodes or scene nodes via code.

If a node can be created in the editor, it should be created there
Only reference nodes by name using GetNode()
Provide clear instructions to the user about what to create in the editor and what to name it
Work collaboratively - let the user build the scene structure
